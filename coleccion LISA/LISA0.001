THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

A PERSONAL VIEW OF THE ZAMBIA LIBRARY SERVICE.

PERSONAL VIEW OF THE SERVICE, BASED ON OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING WORK UNDER THE
VOLUNTARY SERVICES OVERSEAS SCHEME. IN KASAMA, THE PROVINCIAL CENTRE OF THE
NORTHERN PROVINCE, 3 MAJOR PROBLEMS FACED LIBRARY SERVICES-POOR TRANSPORT; THE
LEGACY LEFT BY AN ACTING LIBRARIAN WHO HAD OPERATED HIS OWN KIND OF LIBRARY
SERVICE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY CONFUSED ; AND THE LACK OF PROVISION FOR THE
PRACTICAL TRAINING OF NEWLY QUALIFIED STAFF. IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO
THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF AUTHORITY, DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORT, TRAINING,
PROFESSIONAL STATUS AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.

IFLA CHALLENGES TO ACTION IN THE YEAR OF THE DISABLED.

THE 46TH IFLA CONFERENCE (MANILA, AUG 80), THE 1ST HELD IN A DEVELOPING
COUNTRY, AROUSED UNUSUAL INTEREST AMONG FILIPINO LIBRARIANS AND MEDIA. IFLA'S
OBJECTIVES OF EXTENDING INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING, COOPERATION, DEBATE,
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ALL FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, CURRENTLY THROUGH ITS
PROGRAMMES UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS WAS EMPHASISED. ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR A
COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
RESTING WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE THE YEAR OF THE CHILD MUST BE FOLLOWED UP
ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE YEAR OF THE DISABLED IS A REMINDER
THAT HANDICAPPED PEOPLE IN ALL COUNTRIES LACK EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER
READING GROUPS. WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES MUST NOT INHIBIT THE SEARCH
FOR NEW IDEAS. CHALLENGES ALL LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS TO FOCUS ATTENTION IN 1981
PARTICULARLY ON THE LIBRARY NEED OF BLIND AND OTHER HANDICAPPED READERS.

LIBRARIES, OR HAVE AUTHORITY OVER LIBRARIANS, THAT PEOPLE OF A SCIENTIFIC OR
TECHNICAL BENT HAVE AN IMPORTANT AND RIGHTFUL PLACE IN LIBRARIES. (THE ARTICLE

THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IN MALAYSIA: SUMMARY OF A DISSERTATION.

SUMMARY OF AN MA THESIS SUBMITTED TO THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY, ARCHIVE AND
INFORMATION STUDIES, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON, DEC 75. 150 MALAYSIAN
LIBRARIANS WERE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE MAIN FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER AND THEIR OPINIONS ON THE PROFESSION IN
RELATION TO TRAINING AND EDUCATION. 77 RESPONDED. 58 WERE 24-37 YEARS OLD; 59
WERE FEMALE; 68 HAD A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; 49 CHOSE LIBRARIANSHIP AFTER THEY
FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY; MOST LANDED IN THE PROFESSION BY ACCIDENT; ALL
FAVOURED FURTHER PROFESSIONAL TRAINING (MOST PREFERRED TO GO ABROAD TO GAIN
WIDER EXPERIENCE AND ADSORB NEW IDEAS); 23 WOULD ADVISE THEIR CHILDREN TO BE
LIBRARIANS; 29 HAD PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS WHEN 1ST APPOINTED; 47 HAD
WORKED ONLY IN THEIR PRESENT LIBRARIES; AND MOST LIKED THEIR LIBRARIES BUT
EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH SALARY AND PROMOTION PROSPECTS.

FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CODE.

THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE.

THE EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF 'THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE' ARE REVIEWED AND
SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF THE SUBJECT OF A SCIENTIFIC
DISCIPLINE ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCES
CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 'THE LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND
RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS', AND THE SUBJECT OF SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP AS 'THE
LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS
IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES'. BELIEVES THAT 'SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP' IS NOT AN
INDEPENDENT DISCIPLINE AND ARGUES THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE DISCIPLINE CALLED
'LIBRARY SCIENCE' AND THAT THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP
