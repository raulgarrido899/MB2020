THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

OBJECTIVES OF EXTENDING INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING, COOPERATION, DEBATE,

COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS

LIBRARIANS WERE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE MAIN FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER AND THEIR OPINIONS ON THE PROFESSION IN
RELATION TO TRAINING AND EDUCATION. 77 RESPONDED. 58 WERE 24-37 YEARS OLD; 59
WERE FEMALE; 68 HAD A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; 49 CHOSE LIBRARIANSHIP AFTER THEY
FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY; MOST LANDED IN THE PROFESSION BY ACCIDENT; ALL
FAVOURED FURTHER PROFESSIONAL TRAINING (MOST PREFERRED TO GO ABROAD TO GAIN
WIDER EXPERIENCE AND ADSORB NEW IDEAS); 23 WOULD ADVISE THEIR CHILDREN TO BE
LIBRARIANS; 29 HAD PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS WHEN 1ST APPOINTED; 47 HAD
WORKED ONLY IN THEIR PRESENT LIBRARIES; AND MOST LIKED THEIR LIBRARIES BUT
EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH SALARY AND PROMOTION PROSPECTS.

FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CODE.

LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS

WHITHER SAILIS? THOUGHTS ON THE ROLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION.

THE FOUNDING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE (SAILIS) AS A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FAVOURABLY
RECEIVED NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. ITS STRUCTURE WILL BE DEVELOPED IN

FULL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS AND REALISATION OF ASPIRATIONS OF EVERY GROUP IN

TEXT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND, AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, N. IRELAND BRANCH, HELD
IN BLARNEY, COUNTY CORK IN MAY 80. EXAMINES SOME LIKELY AREAS OF CONCERN OF

COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; AND THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF

LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.
